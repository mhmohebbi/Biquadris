# Biquadris
A remade model of Tetris, part of final project for CS246 - Object Oriented Programming (UW course) 

This repository is about the Biquadris Project which was the final project for CS 246. It received a final mark of 104.6 The source code is available to view upon request, but is not open to the public due to Policy 71 of the University of Waterloo.

This game was written in solely C++ and is composed of 51 .cc and .h files. These modules followed the principles of couopling and cohesion which are essential to allowing this code to be reused and modified in the future for the addition of more features. This modularization also reduces recompilation as 1 change in a certain file likely won't have a huge affect in terms of dependecy for other files.

Below is the UML Diagram for this project was built.
